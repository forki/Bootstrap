# Bootstrap
A scaffolding setup to bootstrap a project to get up and running. 

## Running bootstrap
Bootstrapping can be started by running:
* `build.sh` on unix systems (tested on max os x)
* `build.cmd` on windows systems

## Bootstrapping
The bootstrap.fsx does the following:

1. Check if a paket.exe exists
2. Download the paket.exe if not
3. Use the paket.exe to install dependencies
